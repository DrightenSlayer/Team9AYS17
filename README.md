# Team9AYS17
For our CS154: Formal Languages and Computability class, we developed a theoretical computer using a turing machine.

The machine is a transducer whose input is an assembly language, defined by the project specifcations under S17-Ah.. and whose output is a single unary number (which hypothetically could be parsed and interpreted by another machine as input.

Any machine in JFLAP embedded in the main file, Team_9.jff, may be more up-to-date than the standalone machine found under a subfolder in this repo.
